***canvasXpress*** was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis
at Bristol-Myers Squibb. It supports a large number of [visualizations ](http://www.canvasxpress.org/gallery.html)to display scientific and non-scientific
data. ***canvasXpress*** also includes a standalone unobtrusive data table and a filtering widget to allow data
exploration similar to those only seen in other high-end commercial applications as well as an 'out of the box'
broadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points in all ***canvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can
be easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events
as well as the zooming, panning and drag'n drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its
class.

***canvasXpress*** can be now simply used within R at the console to generate conventional plots, in R-Studio
or seamlessly embeded in [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web applications. This ***CanvasXpress*** library
was created using the [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package.

### Getting Started

You can install the latest version of ***canvasXpress*** from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github('neuhausi/canvasXpress')
